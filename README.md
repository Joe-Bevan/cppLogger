# cppLogger
A single C++ header include for logging messages and primitives for the Windows platform.  
Everything is wraped inside the namespace `Logger`. Therefore, no classes need to be created.  

Example of a function call `Logger::LogMsg("Hello world!");`.

The single include is located under `Logger/src/include`. You're more than welcome to download the whole soloution. It includes a Main.cpp file that demos some of the functions.
